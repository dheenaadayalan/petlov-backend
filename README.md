## Introduction
Welcome to the **PetLov Backend** repository! This project is the backend component of the PetLov application, designed to connect pet owners with potential adopters. The backend is responsible for managing data storage, processing requests, and serving API endpoints to support the frontend application.
This backend service provides a robust API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting pet profiles and adoption listings. It also handles user authentication and other essential server-side operations.

## Features
- RESTful API endpoints for managing pet profiles and adoption listings
- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for pet profiles and adoption listings
- Secure data storage and management
